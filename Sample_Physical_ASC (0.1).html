<div>The <strong>A</strong>nonymous <strong>S</strong>ocial <strong>C</strong>ontract <br/>(Almost first draft) Version 0.1</div>

<p>Each of us is different, unique, and have been affected by the questionable actions of our government. All of us (except the richest 1%) have been forced to sacrifice. Ordinary people get punished for medemeanors like missed payments, while the wealthiest criminals, corporations and 'Banksters' get off with a public apology. Justice is a concept we must revist: We must re-examine the ideas of our ancestors and integrate them with those of our modern times.</p>
<p>I am only one person, and I don't claim to have an answer. The idea or left and right thinking doesn't apply to this mess; We are in this together. Are we really going to continue to let governments decide for us the fate of our health care, enviornment, security, economy, the ability to retire. Our politicians are all free from the fear of unemployment, and are awarded generous pensions. How could they understand our situation? We cannot count on them for a solution. We ask you to gather with us starting October 15th 2011.
